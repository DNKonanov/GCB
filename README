run in terminal these commands:

#install dependencies
sudo apt-get install graphviz python3-graphviz python3-pygraphviz
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

#to start server
python3 gcb_server.py

Great! Now the GCB-service is available on 127.0.0.1

---easy---

You can use full_container.py script to execute the full data processing automatically
Example:

python3 full_container.py -i ~/data/Orthogroups.txt -name Escherichia_coli_sample0

You add a new organism to the local GCB-service by this command, with computed complexity for each genome



---advanced---
to add a new organism you need to download the geneGraph tool from https://github.com/DNKonanov/geneGraph
to export geneGraph results to the service use export_data.py script
